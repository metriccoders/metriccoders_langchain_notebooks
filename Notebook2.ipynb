      "\n",
      "1. Prototyping: LangSmith provides a platform for rapid iteration and experimentation, allowing developers to test out different prompts and models quickly.\n",
      "2. Debugging: When developing new LLM applications, LangSmith tracing is enabled by default, providing clear visibility and debugging information at each step of an LLM sequence. This helps identify and root-cause issues when things go wrong.\n",
      "3. Initial Test Set: LangSmith allows developers to create datasets, which are collections of inputs and reference outputs, and use these to run tests on their LLM applications. These test cases can be uploaded in bulk, created on the fly, or exported from application traces.\n",
      "4. Comparison View: When prototyping different versions of an application and making changes, LangSmith provides a user-friendly comparison view for test runs to track and diagnose regressions in test scores across multiple revisions of the application.\n",
      "5. Beta Testing: LangSmith enables developers to collect more data on how their LLM applications are performing in real-world scenarios. This phase involves developing an understanding of the types of inputs the app is performing well or poorly on and how exactly it’s breaking down in those cases.\n",
      "6. Annotating Traces: LangSmith also supports sending runs to annotation queues, allowing annotators to closely inspect interesting traces and annotate them with respect to different criteria. This helps catch regressions across important evaluation criteria.\n",
      "7. Adding Runs to a Dataset: As the application progresses through the beta testing phase, LangSmith enables users to add runs as examples to datasets, expanding test coverage on real-world scenarios.\n",
      "8. Production: Once the app hits production, LangSmith provides monitoring charts that allow users to track key metrics over time and drill down into specific data points for debugging purposes. Additionally, LangSmith allows for tag and metadata grouping, which enables A/B testing changes in prompt, model, or retrieval strategy.\n"
